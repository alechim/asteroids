# asteroids

A recreation of the classic Asteroids arcade game, built with Python and Pygame. This is my second project from boot.dev.

## About

Control a spaceship as you navigate through space, shooting asteroids to rack up points. Avoid collisions while clearing the screen of incoming threats!

## Installation

Make sure you have Python and Pygame installed:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Usage

Run the program by running the command-line argument:

```bash
python main.py
```

**Controls (currently implemented):**

- **W** - Move forward
- **S** - Move backward
- **A** - Rotate counter-clockwise
- **D** - Rotate clockwise
- **SPACE** - Fire the lasers
